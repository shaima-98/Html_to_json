This Python script parses an HTML file containing multiple tables of data using BeautifulSoup, extracts specific information from these tables, and organizes the extracted data into structured categories. The data is categorized into lists such as 'scfa_data,' 'gut_brain_data,' and so on, based on the table's position in the HTML file. Subsequently, the script compiles these categorized data into a dictionary, 'func_data,' where each category corresponds to a specific data list. Finally, the extracted and organized data is written to a JSON file, making it accessible in a structured format for further analysis or utilization in other applications.
